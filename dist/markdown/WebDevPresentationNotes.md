# Notable Frameworks

### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
A quick, low level web framework and server built off of Javascript and the V8 engine. One of the fastest web frameworks around.

### [Spring MVC](http://spring.io/) and [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/)
These are two notable Java web frameworks. Play framework is meant for quick, easy development with Java whereas Spring is meant for larger, more enterprise websites.

### [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
These are two web frameworks that are designed for quick development and deployment. These are both built off of easy to use and easy to learn scripting languages. Django is built off on python and Ruby on Rails is built off of ruby.

### [Angularjs](https://angularjs.org/)
There is also an Angularjs [tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/) on [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/)


## Content Management Systems
CMS's (Content Management System) are made for users to create and manage content quickly and easily. These are typically used for blogs or for getting a website up quickly. This is a good alternative to writing your own site from scratch or from using a web framework because it affords you many tools out of the box. This means less code and quicker deployment.

### [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/)
These are some notable CMS's out there. If you want to get started with a CMS, I recommend Wordpress.

# Working Locally
When developing a website, you can run your server on your computer locally and not push it onto the web. Most web frameworks will allow you to run the web server locally for development.

### Lamp / Wamp / Nginx
If you are using PHP or want to create a website without a framework, then you will need to setup a server locally. Apache and Nginx are your best choices for this. Apache being the more popular choice and Nginx being the more optimized one.



# Getting on the Web
At some point, you will want to get your website onto the internet and make it viewable to the public. You will need to have your website hosted on a server and have a domain name.

## Domain Names
You will need to get a domain name for your website. For example, franknfurter.com would be a domain name that you might purchase. The cost depends on the name and the name might already be taken. You can get a free domain at namecheap.com. More on this later.

### Where to Buy
- [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/?gclid=CM7trs_VssQCFQaQaQod-VsAeQ)
- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)
- [name.com](https://www.name.com/)

## Hosting
The next thing you would need to do is host your website on server. You can buy your own server and host it yourself, but for many reasons you would want to host your server remotely. You can host it on a dedicated server, VPS (Virtual Private Server), or on the cloud. You can get a shared hosting plan.

### Free Web Hosting for CSULB Students
You can setup your student account to host your own website at www.csulb.edu/~username. This is an ftp server. You can setup something with simple html. You can also do something with Angularjs incase you want something more usable.

To set this up, you would need to talk with the [Technology Help Desk](http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/aa/academic_technology/thd/). They will activate your account and give you your username and password to use. They are located at Academic Services Bldg Room 120. This building is right next to BeachHut and the University Library.

You can also email them at [helpdesk@csulb.edu](helpdesk@csulb.edu) or call them at 562-985-4959.

### [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
You can get $100 worth of Digital Ocean credit for free. More on this below. This platform allows you to create servers and drop them very easily. You also can pay by the minute rather than monthly. This saves you money because you won't be paying for when the server is down. The setup is also quick and painless.

### [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/)
OpenShift allows you to host your site for free in the cloud.

### [Siteground](https://www.siteground.com/)
This is an all around good, cheap host. There are others out there, but I have used this one personally. It starts at $4 a month. Cheap and easy to use.
